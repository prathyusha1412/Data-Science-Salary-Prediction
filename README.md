# Data-Science-Salary-Prediction

# Overview
This project aims to predict data science job salaries using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, our study explores the relationship between salary and key factors like job title, experience level, work model, and company size. This project leverages various machine learning models, including Random Forest Regression, which was optimized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and hyperparameter tuning to achieve high accuracy.

# Dataset
Job title
Experience level
Employment type
Work model
Employee residence
Company size
Salary in USD

# Workflow
1. Data Collection: Dataset sourced from Kaggle.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and log-transforming the salary variable.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and summarizing the dataset to identify trends and outliers.
4. Feature Engineering: Creating new features and reducing skewness in variables.
5. Model Building: Training and testing various machine learning models.
6. Optimization: Applying PCA and hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.

# Key Features
1. Salary prediction for data science roles.
2. Analysis of factors influencing salary, such as job title, experience, and company size.
3. Visualizations, including histograms, boxplots, and violin plots, for data exploration.

# Models Used
The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. Decision Tree Regression
5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
6. Random Forest Regression (Best-performing model)
